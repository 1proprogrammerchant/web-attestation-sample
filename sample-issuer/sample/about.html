    <h1>Sample UWA Issuer About Page</h1>

    <p>This is the About page of a sample Issuer of User-centric Web Attestations (UWA); see the [github project page](https://github.com/microsoft/web-attestation-sample) and the [specification](https://github.com/microsoft/web-attestation-sample/blob/main/doc/uwa-spec.md) for details.</p>

    <p>This is where a real Issuer would describe the tokens it issues; and explain how and to whom they issue them. Odds are you landed on this page by verifying a sample or demo UWA badge; this attestation MUST NOT be trusted in real-life as the corresponding sample Issuer keys are part of this public repository.</p>
