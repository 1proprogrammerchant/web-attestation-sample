## Extensions

This project is a sample proof-of-concept, with many possible extensions:
* Project updates
  * Move to TypeScript
* Improved security
  * Protect private keys to avoid transferability
  * Token Information to contain a typed attribute, to avoid free-form field from the issuer
  * Replace extension ui elements in a tab with IFrames using an origin different from the tab;  
    this way the tab scripting cannot manipulate the DOM of extension provided elements.
