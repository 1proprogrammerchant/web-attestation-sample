Pre-release TODO list

* Add "Trust issuer" button in the Issuer tab, using current meta tag URL
* Support multiple JWK per JWKS (issuer store will need to index issuer params with UIDP)
* Enable Token Information field's label (also add label type to avoid )
* Encode uwa as QR code; allow extension to verify them (check all images, or add a "verify" in the [context menu](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/contextMenus/))
* TODO: FIXME: delete this file :)
