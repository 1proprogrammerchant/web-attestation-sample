Pre-release TODO list

* Fix "Get token" UI, tokens table doesn't refresh, and sometimes errors out (you have to reload the page to fix)
* Create a more compact encoding for UWA (v2)
* Encrypt keys and tokens in the extension (v2)
* Add a Badges popup tab to show a list of validated UWA on the current page (v2)
* Make the badge popup about link clickable (v2)
* CI (codeql), https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension (v2)
* Generate samples using static issuer params on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/web-attestation-sample/main/sample-issuer/sample
* Replace extension ui elements in a tab with IFrames using an origin different from the tab; this way the tab scripting cannot manipulate the DOM of extension provided elements.
* TODO: FIXME: delete this file :)
