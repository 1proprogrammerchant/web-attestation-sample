Pre-release TODO list

* Write README
* Write spec
* Add "Trust issuer" button in the Issuer tab, using current meta tag URL
* Support multiple JWK per JWKS (issuer store will need to index issuer params with UIDP)
* Enable Token Information field's label (also add label type to avoid )
* TODO: FIXME: delete this file :)
